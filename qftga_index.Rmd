These are my notes on "Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur" by Lancaster & Blundell. The links below lead to short summaries of the chapters and solutions to some of the problems at the end of the chapters. Naturally the correctness of neither is guranteed. 


## IV: Propagators and perturbations

- Ch 16: Propagators and Green's functions
- Ch 17: Propagators and fields
- Ch 18: The S-matrix
- Ch 19: Expanding the S-matrix: Feynman diagrams
- Ch 20: Scattering theory 

## V: Interlude: wisdom from statistical physics

- Ch 21: Statistical physics: a crash course
