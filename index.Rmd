## Hi!

My name is Faisal Alam and I am an undergraduate physics and mathematics major at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA.

Despite the best of my efforts I have always been lousy at keeping coherent, organized notes on my classes and independent studies. This was a fine (but not ideal) way to go about my studies in high school classes. But now I find it increasingly difficult to retain things that I am learning. The course contents are more difficult to digest, textbooks are opaque and there is quite enough to do every day without having to relearn material that I should already know.

This website will serve as a repository of bits and pieces of notes or blog posts on various topics of interest to me, things that I am bubbling to share with someone, things that are too big for me to grapple with in my mind. A Dumbledorian Pensieve if you will!

I may also write posts compiling study materials that I have found particularly helpful or the occasional rant about certain aspects of contemporary literature.
